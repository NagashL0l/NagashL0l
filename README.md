As a Level 2 Cybersecurity Analyst in a SOC, I have spent the last two years honing my skills in threat detection, incident response, and digital forensics. My work has involved leveraging advanced security tools and techniques to protect sensitive information.  

### More about me:
  
üêß I'm a passionate home **Linux** user, actively involved in the community. 

üå± I'm currently learning about **malware development**, **reverse engineering** and **vulnerability assessment**.  

üõ†Ô∏è At this moment I'm developing scripts in **Bash** and **Python** to analyze threads/IOCs and coding malware with **Rust ü¶Ä**.
